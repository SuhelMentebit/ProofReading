            data: "<p>The <b>Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)</b> is the United States Air Force's (USAF) only federal community college. Established in 1972, the college serves to provide enlisted personnel with educational opportunities to improve their career prospects and to facilitate their successful transition to civilian life. CCAF grants associate of applied science degree in more than sixty career fields, including aircraft maintenance, space systems technology, information management, and intelligence studies.</p><p>The CCAF was established on October 1, 1972, by order of the Secretary of the Air Force, with the expressed goal of providing educational opportunities for Air Force personnel. Prior to its creation, Air Force personnel had limited access to higher education opportunities. The launch of the CCAF was also an effort to reduce attrition rates among Air Force personnel, as well as to help them receive promotions.</p><p>In 1975, the CCAF was awarded accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which is the same accreditation awarded to traditional community colleges. CCAF has since been re-accredited multiple times and continues to be held to the same standards as traditional colleges and universities.</p><p>In addition to the associate of applied science degrees, the CCAF also offers many certificates and other educational opportunities. The college works with a network of more than 1,000 civilian institutions across the United States to provide students with additional educational support and resources. The CCAF also provides students with career counseling, mentoring, and job placement services.</p><p>Today, the CCAF is the largest community college in the United States and serves more than 300,000 active duty and retired Air Force personnel each year. The college continues to provide quality educational opportunities for military personnel and has become a model for other branches of the military.</p>"
