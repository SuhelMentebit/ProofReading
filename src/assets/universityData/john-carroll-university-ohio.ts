            data: "<p><b>John Carroll University</b> is located in University Heights, Ohio, and is an independent, Catholic university founded in 1886 by the Society of Jesuits. The school was initially named St. Ignatius College, after the founder of the Jesuit order, St. Ignatius of Loyola. The school was renamed John Carroll University in 1923 after John Carroll, the first bishop and Archbishop of Baltimore, and the founder of the first Catholic diocese in the United States. </p><p>The university was originally located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio and had just 88 students enrolled. Over the next century, the university grew in size and added new academic programs, including the first master’s degree program in business administration in Cleveland in 1934, and the first doctorate program in education in the United States in 1968. </p><p>Today, the university offers more than 70 undergraduate programs, 16 graduate programs, and 11 doctoral programs, and enrolls more than 4,000 students. The university campus covers more than 200 acres and includes more than 50 academic, athletic, and residence buildings.</p>"
