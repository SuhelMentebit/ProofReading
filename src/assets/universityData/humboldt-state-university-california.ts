            data: "<p><b>Humboldt State University (HSU)</b> was founded in 1913 as a state-funded, teacher-training institution. Initially, the school was known as the Humboldt Normal School, and its main purpose was to train teachers and support the local community in educating its children. </p><p>In 1921, it was renamed Humboldt State Teachers College, and the program was expanded to include liberal arts and sciences. In 1935, the school was renamed again, this time to Humboldt State College, to reflect its expanded curriculum. By the 1950s, the college had grown to become a full-fledged university.</p><p>In 1974, Humboldt State University became part of the California State University system, which is made up of 23 universities in the state. Today, HSU is home to over 8,000 students and offers over 130 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Additionally, HSU has a strong emphasis on environmental education, research, and sustainability, and is the only university in the United States to have a faculty-led sustainability doctoral program.</p>"
