These protests culminated in the 1970 Kent State shootings, which left four students dead and nine wounded. The shootings brought national attention to the university and helped to reshape the political climate on campus.</p><p>Since the 1970s, Kent State has continued to grow and expand its academic offerings. The university now offers more than 300 undergraduate programs and over 200 graduate programs.
