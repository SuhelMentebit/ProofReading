            data: "<p><b>Fisk University</b> is a private historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee. It was founded in 1866 and is one of the oldest universities in the United States. Its founding was part of the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, when efforts were made to expand educational opportunities for freedmen and other historically disadvantaged populations.</p><p>Fisk was founded in 1866 by General Clinton B. Fisk of the Tennessee Freedmen's Bureau and John Ogden, a white teacher from Ohio. The two men were appointed by the American Missionary Association (AMA) to establish a school for the newly freed African-American population. The school was originally named Fisk Free Colored School, and the students were mainly former slaves who had been freed by the Emancipation Proclamation.</p><p>In 1868, the school was chartered as Fisk University, and the AMA assumed responsibility for its governance. In 1871, the university was the first African-American institution to become a member of the American Association of Universities. In 1875, the university moved to its current site on a 40-acre campus in the heart of Nashville.</p><p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the university played an important role in the intellectual development of the African-American community in Nashville and the South. It was a major center for the education of African-American teachers, physicians, and lawyers and was a leader in the struggle for civil rights.</p><p>Today, Fisk University is a comprehensive university offering undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees in a wide range of fields. The university has a strong commitment to excellence in teaching and research, and is dedicated to the promotion of social and economic justice.</p>"
