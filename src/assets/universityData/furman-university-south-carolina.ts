            data: "<p><b>Furman University</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Greenville, South Carolina. Founded in 1826 as the Furman Academy and Theological Institution, it is the oldest university in South Carolina. The university first began offering college-level courses in 1830 and was chartered as an institution of higher learning in December 1851.</p><p>Furman has a long and storied history that begins in the early 19th century. The school was founded by the South Carolina Baptist Convention, with the intention of providing a Christian education to the children of the region. The original school was known as the Furman Academy and Theological Institution and was located in Edgefield, South Carolina.</p><p>In 1851, the school was incorporated and became known as Furman University. It then moved to the current location in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1852. The school was initially funded by the South Carolina Baptist Convention and was intended to provide a Baptist education to the region’s youth.</p><p>The university has gone through a number of changes over the years. In the late 19th century, the school became coeducational and in 1895 it became a non-sectarian institution, meaning it no longer had any religious affiliation. This allowed the school to broaden its student base and become a more diverse institution.</p><p>In the early 20th century, Furman underwent a period of expansion and modernization. The school added new buildings, increased the size of its faculty, and began offering new degree programs.</p><p>Today, Furman is a highly respected and well-regarded liberal arts college with over 2,700 students and 300 faculty members. The university offers 45 majors and 40 minors, and boasts a strong academic reputation.</p>"
