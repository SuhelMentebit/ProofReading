            data: "<p><b>Aviation in Australia</b> has a long and proud history, with the nation having played a major role in the development of civil aviation since the early 1900s. The first recorded flight in Australia was made in 1910 by Harry Houdini in a modified powered airship at Diggers Rest, Victoria.</p><p>In 1911 the first airfield in Queensland was established at Charleville, and the first regular airmail services between Melbourne and Sydney began in 1921. From the 1930s onwards, Australia's civil aviation industry began to expand rapidly, particularly in the north of the country.</p><p>During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) played a crucial role in the defence of Australia and its possessions, and helped to protect vital shipping lanes in the Pacific. In the post-war years, civil aviation became increasingly important in Australia, particularly with the development of the civil aviation industry in the north.</p><p>By the 1960s, Australia had developed a comprehensive network of airports and air routes, and had become a major hub for international air travel. Today, the country has a thriving aviation industry, with a wide range of airlines operating domestic and international flights to destinations across the world.</p>"
