            data: "<p><b>Guilford College</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Greensboro, North Carolina. Founded in 1837 by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), Guilford is the third-oldest Quaker-affiliated college in the United States and the first to be founded in North Carolina. </p><p>The college's founding was part of a general revitalization of Quakerism in the south following the American Revolutionary War. Guilford is one of the few Quaker colleges in the world and the only one in the United States that remains affiliated with the Religious Society of Friends. </p><p>Guilford College was founded in 1837 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). The college was established on land that had been part of the Benjamin Briggs farm. Briggs, a Quaker and a local judge, had purchased the land in 1771. The college's first president was David Scull, a Quaker educator who had founded a school at nearby New Garden. </p><p>The college's original charter was granted by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1838. Initially, the college was founded as a two-year school for the education of Quaker ministers. In 1845, the college was expanded to include a four-year program. </p><p>In the late 19th century, the college was an important center of the Quaker movement in the South. It was the site of numerous important Quaker conferences, including the 1899 Annual Meeting of Friends. </p><p>Today, Guilford College remains one of the few Quaker colleges in the world and the only one in the United States that remains affiliated with the Religious Society of Friends. The college continues to offer its students a rigorous liberal arts education that is rooted in Quaker values of community, service, and social justice.</p>"
