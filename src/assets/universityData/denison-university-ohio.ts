Denison is consistently ranked as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the country and is one of the Great Eight colleges of the Midwest.

The university is also known for its extensive extracurricular activities and student organizations. The school's motto is "Mens Agitat Molem" (Mind Moves Matter). </p><p>Denison was founded in 1831 by a group of Presbyterians who wanted to create a school in the Ohio Valley that would provide a quality education with a Christian foundation. The university was first located in Granville, Ohio, and was originally named Granville College. In 1837, the school changed its name to Denison University. In 1838, the school moved to its current location in Granville, Ohio. </p><p>Throughout its history, Denison has maintained a strong commitment to liberal arts education, though it has also sought to keep pace with a changing world by introducing new academic programs and initiatives.
