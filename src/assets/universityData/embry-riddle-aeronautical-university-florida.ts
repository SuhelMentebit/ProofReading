            data: "<p><b>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</b> was founded in 1926 by John Paul Riddle and T. Higbee Embry in order to provide quality aviation education to students. The University was initially established as the Embry-Riddle Company, a flight school that provided pilot training and aircraft maintenance services. In 1965, the company merged with the Aviation Corporation of America (AVCO) and became the largest flight school in the United States. In 1978, Embry-Riddle became a four-year college and was renamed Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In 1985, the University opened its first international campus in England. In 1993, the University established its first residential campus in Daytona Beach, Florida. The University has since grown to include campuses in Prescott, Arizona; Daytona Beach, Florida; and Worldwide, offering both online and on-campus degree programs in Aviation, Aeronautics, Business, and Computer Science.</p>"
