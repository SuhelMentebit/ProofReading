            data: "<p>The <b>American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service (AAMI)</b> was established in 1927 in New York City as the first school of mortuary science in the United States. It was founded by Arthur C. McAllister, a funeral director and embalmer, who had the vision to offer an educational program for funeral directors. AAMI was the first of its kind to offer a two-year curriculum in mortuary science, and since its founding, the school has been at the forefront of funeral service education.</p><p>In the 1950s, the Academy moved to its current location in the Bronx and became a division of New York University. This allowed students to receive a full college degree from NYU upon completion of the program.</p><p>Today, AAMI is a leading educational institution for funeral directors across the country. The Academy continues to offer an Associate of Occupational Studies (AOS) degree in Mortuary Science, along with a variety of certificate programs and seminars. AAMI’s mission is to provide quality education and training to prepare students for a successful career in funeral service.</p>"
