            data: "<p><b>Blue Quills University</b> is a First Nations university located in St. Paul, Alberta, Canada. It is the only university in Canada owned and operated by a First Nations people. The school was founded in 1972 by the St. Paul Education Authority, an organization made up of representatives from the St. Paul Métis Settlement and the four local First Nations. It was established to provide post-secondary educational opportunities to the Indigenous people of Alberta. </p><p>The school initially offered a two-year program leading to a diploma in Native Studies. In 1975, it became the first Native Studies program in Canada to be accredited by the Alberta government. By the early 1980s, the school had expanded to a four-year program and was offering bachelor's degrees in Native Studies, Business Administration, and Education. </p><p>In 1995, the school changed its name to Blue Quills First Nations College, and in 2000, it was granted university status and renamed Blue Quills University. The university's mission is to provide quality post-secondary education to its Indigenous students, while at the same time preserving and promoting Indigenous culture, language, and values. It offers a variety of degree and certificate programs in areas such as Indigenous Studies, Business Administration, Education, and Health Care.</p>"
