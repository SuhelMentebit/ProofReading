            data: "<p>The history of <b>Florida State College at Jacksonville's Downtown Campus</b> dates back to 1966 when the college was founded as Florida Junior College (FJC). Originally, the Downtown Campus was located in the old Duval County Courthouse and the first classes for FJC were held on September 8, 1966. The college was then renamed Florida Community College at Jacksonville in 1988 and became part of the State College System of Florida. The college was then renamed again in 2009 to become Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ). The Downtown Campus moved to its current location on State Street in 2006 and has since grown to include multiple buildings, including the Advanced Technology Center, the Advanced Technology Center Annex and the Urban Resource Center. The Downtown Campus also houses the FSCJ Culinary Institute, the Education and Training Center, and the Wilson Center for the Arts. Today, FSCJ's Downtown Campus serves more than 4,000 students each year and offers a variety of degree and certificate programs.</p>"
