            data: "<p><b>Canadian Mennonite University (CMU)</b> began as a Bible college in 1947, founded by the Mennonite Brethren Church in Manitoba. It was originally known as the Mennonite Brethren Bible College and was located in what was then the rural area of south Winnipeg. In 1970, the college changed its name to Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary, and in 1972 it became an accredited degree-granting institution known as Canadian Mennonite Bible College.</p><p>In 1993, CMU was granted the authority to become a university and was renamed Canadian Mennonite University. In 2009, CMU opened a new campus in Shaftesbury, Manitoba, and in March 2012, the university celebrated the official opening of its new main campus in south Winnipeg. The university has since grown to offer undergraduate and graduate degrees in a variety of disciplines, including business, education, music, counselling and psychology, and more.</p>"
