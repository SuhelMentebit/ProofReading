            data: "<p><b>Colby College</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Waterville, Maine. Founded in 1813 by the Maine Legislature, it is the 12th oldest liberal arts college in the United States and the first college in Maine. It was founded as the Maine Literary and Theological Institution and was renamed Colby College in 1867 after its major benefactor, Gardner Colby.</p><p>Colby was one of the first American colleges to offer instruction in the sciences and was the first college to grant a degree to an African American woman. The college played a role in the abolitionist movement and its graduates were active in the American Civil War.</p><p>At the turn of the 20th century, Colby experienced significant growth and modernization. The college introduced new majors, established a library, and became a leader in the development of the sciences in the region. In the 1940s and 1950s, Colby underwent a period of growth, expanding its campus and constructing a number of new buildings. In the 1960s, Colby moved to a more liberal curriculum and expanded its international programs. In the 1970s, the college began to focus on increasing its endowment and raising funds for renovation and expansion projects.</p><p>Today, Colby College is one of the most highly regarded liberal arts colleges in the United States, with a diverse student body and an emphasis on experiential learning. The college offers more than fifty majors and minors and has an endowment of more than $750 million. Colby is also home to the Colby Museum of Art and the Colby College Library.</p>"
