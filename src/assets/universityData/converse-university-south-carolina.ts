            data: "<p><b>Converse College</b> was founded in 1889 in Spartanburg, South Carolina as a women’s college. Inspired by the legacy of the Converse family, it was the vision of local philanthropist Dexter Edgar Converse to provide young women with the same educational opportunities as men.</p><p>In the early 1900s, Converse College began to expand its academic offerings, adding a liberal arts curriculum, with a focus on the sciences, in 1905. By the 1920s, the college had started to gain recognition as a leader in education for women. In the 1930s, the college began offering classes for professional degrees in education and music.</p><p>In the 1950s, Converse College began to expand its campus and its academic offerings, including the introduction of graduate degree programs. In 1959, the college was officially renamed Converse University, and it began to become more diverse, with the enrollment of its first African-American student in 1964.</p><p>Throughout the 1960s, Converse University continued to grow and expand its academic programs, becoming one of the most respected women’s colleges in the region. In 1972, the college began admitting male students, and in 1976, it became a fully co-educational institution.</p><p>Today, Converse University is still one of the leading educational institutions in the region, offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs. It is also home to the Converse College Historic District, a nationally registered historic district that includes several of the original campus buildings.</p>"
