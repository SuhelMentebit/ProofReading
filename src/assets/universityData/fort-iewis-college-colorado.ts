            data: "<p><b>Fort Lewis College (FLC)</b> is a public liberal arts college located in Durango, Colorado. Founded in 1911 as a military school, it was originally known as the Fort Lewis A&M College. It is one of the four state universities of Colorado and is the only one in the western part of the state. In its early days, the college had a strong focus on military training and the cadets were required to wear a uniform.</p><p>In the 1950s, the college began to transition away from its military heritage and towards a more traditional liberal arts college. The college became coeducational in 1965, and in 1966, the name was changed from Fort Lewis A&M College to Fort Lewis College. The college has continued to grow and expand its academic and extracurricular offerings. Today, the college is home to over 4,000 students and offers bachelor’s degrees in more than 50 majors, as well as master's and doctoral degrees in several areas of study. The college also has a robust athletics program, with NCAA Division II teams in football, basketball, soccer, baseball, softball, and other sports.</p>"
