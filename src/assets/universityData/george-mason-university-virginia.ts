            data: "<p><b>George Mason University (GMU)</b> is a public research university in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1957 as a Northern Virginia branch of the University of Virginia and became an independent institution in 1972. Today, George Mason University is the largest public research university in Virginia and is recognized as a Carnegie Research University with High Research Activity. </p><p>The university's origins can be traced back to the establishment of the Northern Virginia branch of the University of Virginia in 1949. The branch campus was originally part of the University of Virginia's extension program to serve the growing population of Northern Virginia. In 1956, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to convert the branch into an independent institution under the name of George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The college was named after the founding father George Mason, a Virginia statesman and a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. George Mason College opened its doors to students in 1957 with a total enrollment of 676. </p><p>In 1972, the college was recognized as an independent institution and was officially granted university status by the state of Virginia. The name of the university was changed to George Mason University. The university has since grown to become the largest public research university in Virginia with an enrollment of over 38,000 students. It offers over 200 degree programs through its 11 schools and colleges and has established numerous research centers and programs, including the National Center for Biodefense and Security and the Center for the Arts. </p><p>George Mason University has been ranked among the top universities in the United States for many years. It is currently ranked #119 in the 2021 U.S. News & World Report National University Rankings.</p>"
