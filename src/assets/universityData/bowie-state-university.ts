            data: "<p><b>Bowie State University</b> is the oldest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Maryland. Established in 1865, the university was founded by the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People. Initially, the school was a teacher-training institution, and its primary purpose was to prepare African-American teachers for the newly desegregated public school system in the state of Maryland. </p><p>In the early 1900s, Bowie State began to expand its offerings beyond teacher education to include degrees in business, home economics, science, and the liberal arts. In 1935, the school was renamed the Maryland State Teachers College at Bowie and was granted the authority to confer bachelor’s degrees. In 1963, it was renamed Bowie State College, and in 1988, it achieved university status and was renamed Bowie State University. </p><p>Today, Bowie State University is a comprehensive university offering more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the arts and sciences, business, education, and professional studies. The university is recognized for its commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and service.</p>"
