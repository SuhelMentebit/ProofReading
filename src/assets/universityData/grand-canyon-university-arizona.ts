            data: "<p><b>Grand Canyon University (GCU)</b> was founded in 1949 as a private, nondenominational, Christian university in Phoenix, Arizona. It was originally founded as Grand Canyon College and was operated by the Arizona Southern Baptist Convention. The college initially focused on preparing students for service in Christian ministry and other religious vocations. In the late 1960s, the college shifted to a more traditional liberal arts and sciences curriculum, and in the 1970s and 1980s, it began to offer more professional and career-oriented degree programs.</p><p>In the 1990s, Grand Canyon College began offering distance learning programs, and in 2004, it changed its name to Grand Canyon University. In 2008, the university became a for-profit institution and began offering more online programs and courses.</p><p>Today, Grand Canyon University is a comprehensive, private, Christian university that offers more than 200 degree programs to students around the world. The university has grown over the years and now serves more than 75,000 students each year. GCU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.</p>"
