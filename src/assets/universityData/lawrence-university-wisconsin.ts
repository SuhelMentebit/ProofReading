            data: "<p><b>Lawrence University</b>, located in Appleton, Wisconsin, is a private liberal arts college and conservatory of music. Founded in 1847, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state. Its founders, Amos Lawrence and William Harkness, were inspired by the New England tradition of liberal arts education and the idea of a university open to all.</p><p>The university began as Lawrence Institute, a preparatory school. In 1853, it was incorporated as Lawrence University and began offering collegiate courses. The conservatory of music was established in 1874, and in 1892 the university was granted a charter by the state of Wisconsin. </p><p>The university expanded rapidly in the early 20th century, particularly in the sciences. In 1957, Lawrence merged with the Women's College of the University of Wisconsin, a move that increased the university's size and diversity. </p><p>Today, Lawrence University continues to serve students from the Midwest and beyond with a variety of liberal arts and music programs. The university is part of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and has an 11:1 student-faculty ratio. Lawrence is also home to the Wriston Art Center, a museum and gallery dedicated to the exhibition and preservation of art.</p>"
