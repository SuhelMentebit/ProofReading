            data: "<p><b>Harvard University</b> is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was named after the College’s first benefactor, the young minister John Harvard of Charlestown, who upon his death in 1638 left his library and half his estate to the institution. A statue of John Harvard stands today in front of University Hall in Harvard Yard, and is perhaps the University’s best known landmark.</p><p>Harvard University initially operated as a small college of about 30 students and a handful of faculty. It slowly grew over the next two centuries and began to offer more advanced degrees and professional programs. Today, Harvard is one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world, with a student body of over 20,000 and a faculty of nearly 4,000. The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Harvard has several art museums and four major research libraries housing more than 18 million volumes. Harvard also operates several recreational and athletic facilities, including the Harvard Stadium and the Bright Hockey Center.</p>"
