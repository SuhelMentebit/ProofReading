            data: "<p><b>Albion College</b> was founded in 1835 in Albion, Michigan, USA, as the Albion Academy. It was the first college to be established in Michigan and the third to be established in the Midwest. It is a private liberal arts college affiliated with the United Methodist Church. The college is home to more than 1,200 students and has a faculty of over 150.</p><p>The college was established by Methodist pioneers who wanted to provide higher education to the people in the area. The school opened with just 10 faculty members, but enrollment quickly grew. By 1845, enrollment had risen to over 200 students and the college was officially chartered as Albion College. In 1847, the college moved to its current location on the banks of the Kalamazoo River.</p><p>Throughout the 19th century, Albion College continued to grow and expand, adding new departments and programs. The college also built a new library in the late 19th century, which is still in use today. In the early 20th century, the college began to focus on strengthening its academic programs, and it has since become one of Michigan’s premier liberal arts colleges.</p><p>Today, Albion College offers more than 40 majors and minors, and its alumni network consists of over 25,000 individuals. The college is also home to several renowned research and teaching centers, including the Gerald R. Ford Institute for Leadership in Public Policy and Service, the Albion College Center for Sustainability, and the Albion College Center for Health and Human Performance.</p>"
