            data: "<p><b>Gwynedd Mercy University</b>, located in Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1948 by the Sisters of Mercy. Originally known as Gwynedd Mercy College, the institution was dedicated to providing high-quality education through a Catholic, Mercy-centered tradition. The college was fully accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in 1963, and since then, has grown from a small, liberal arts-focused college to a comprehensive university offering both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. </p><p>In 2005, the college underwent a major expansion, adding a new nursing program and opening a satellite campus in Center City, Philadelphia. In addition, the college also increased its physical presence in Gwynedd Valley, adding several new buildings and expanding its academic offerings to include a master’s degree in business administration. </p><p>In 2008, the college changed its name to Gwynedd Mercy University, in recognition of its expanded academic offerings and its commitment to providing quality education to students of all backgrounds. In the years since, the university has continued to grow, adding more degree programs and expanding its campus to include a residence hall and additional campus buildings. </p><p>Today, Gwynedd Mercy University offers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs, including business, nursing, and health sciences, as well as an array of liberal arts majors. The university is dedicated to providing a comprehensive education that emphasizes the Mercy values of respect, integrity, service, and justice.</p>"
