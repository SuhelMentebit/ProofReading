            data: "<p><b>Fordham University</b> is a private research university located in New York City, USA. It was founded in 1841 by the Catholic Diocese of New York and named after the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx. Fordham is the oldest Catholic university in the northeastern United States, the third-oldest university in New York, and the only Jesuit university in New York City. </p><p>Fordham was founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the Irish-born coadjutor bishop of New York, John Hughes. The college was established in the village of Fordham, then part of Westchester County, and was opened to male students in 1841 and to female students in 1892. In 1907, the college moved from Fordham to its current location in the Bronx, occupying a portion of the former estate of the late 19th-century industrialist, financier, and railroad magnate William Henry Vanderbilt. </p><p>Fordham was the first Catholic university in the northeast to admit non-Catholics, and its inaugural class included several non-Catholics. In 1921, the college was officially renamed Fordham University. </p><p>Today, Fordham is a research university with campuses in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester County. The university offers more than 60 majors, numerous minors, and more than 60 graduate programs. Fordham is renowned for its commitment to academic excellence, its commitment to social justice, and its dedication to preparing students for lives of service and leadership.</p>"
