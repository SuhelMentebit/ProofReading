            data: "<p><b>Longerenong College</b>, located near Horsham in Victoria, Australia, was established in 1887 as a training college for farmers, graziers and agricultural workers. It is a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) that offers a wide range of qualifications in agriculture, horticulture and environmental management. It is the only college in Australia that specializes in providing agricultural education and training to students from all over the country.</p><p>The college was originally founded by a group of local farmers and graziers who wanted to create a facility that would provide education and skills training in agriculture and horticulture. The first classes were held in a small building on the college grounds, but soon the college moved to a larger building known as the Longerenong Homestead. </p><p>Over the years, the college has grown and developed to become a modern educational facility offering a range of courses in agriculture, horticulture, business and technology. It is now one of the largest agricultural training colleges in Australia, with a total enrolment of over 4,000 students.</p><p>The college is also home to a large research farm, which is dedicated to developing new methods of sustainable land management and food production. It is also involved in a number of research projects that aim to improve the efficiency of agricultural processes. </p><p>In 2006, the college was awarded the Victorian Training Award for its commitment to providing quality training and education. It is one of the few training organisations in Australia that has been recognised by both the Australian and Victorian governments for its excellence in training.</p>"
