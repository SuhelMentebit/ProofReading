            data: "<p><b>Drake University</b>, located in Des Moines, Iowa, was founded in 1881. The school was founded by a group of local church leaders, led by Francis Marion Drake, who sought to create a university that would provide accessible higher education to the people of Iowa.</p><p>The first classes were held in the fall of 1881. The university initially consisted of a single building, known as Old Main, which housed classrooms, an auditorium, and the university library. In the following years, several other buildings were constructed, including the iconic Sheslow Auditorium, which was built in 1909.</p><p>Throughout the 20th century, the university continued to grow. In 1965, Drake became the first private university in the Midwest to offer an accredited nursing program. The university also established the first collegiate program of its kind to offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in graphic design. In the present day, the university offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, and has an enrollment of more than 5,000 students.</p>"
