            data: "<p><b>Bacone College</b> is a small, private college located in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Founded in 1880 by the American Baptist Home Mission Society, Bacone has a long and rich history as one of the oldest colleges in the state.</p><p>The college was established in 1880 by Almon C. Bacone, a missionary from Maine who was sent to the Indian Territory in 1878 to provide educational opportunities to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Initially called the Indian University, the school opened with only 23 students and one faculty member. Over the next few decades, the school served as a preparatory school and junior college, and was renamed Bacone College in 1919 in honor of its founder.</p><p>In 1951, the college moved to its current location in Muskogee. During the 1950s and 1960s, Bacone underwent significant expansion, adding new buildings, departments and programs. In the 1970s, the college began to focus on its cultural heritage, adding a museum and arts center to the campus.</p><p>Today, Bacone College offers more than 20 undergraduate and graduate programs, including majors in business, education, and the sciences. The college also has a strong commitment to its Native American heritage, with a Native American Studies program, a museum, and a Native American Center for Applied Studies.</p>"
