            data: "<p><b>Kansas State University</b> was founded in 1863 as the state’s first public institution of higher learning. It was originally known as the Kansas State Agricultural College and located in Manhattan, Kansas. The college was authorized to grant degrees in 1875, and the first degrees were awarded in 1880. In 1863 the school was designated a land grant college under the Morrill Act, which provided federal land to states for the purpose of establishing universities.</p><p>Throughout its history, Kansas State University has been devoted to education and research in the agricultural sciences. The school was a leader in agricultural research and education during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 1920s, the school began to expand its offerings to include other disciplines such as engineering, business, and home economics. In 1965, the name of the school was changed to Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Science to reflect its broadened mission.</p><p>Today, Kansas State University is a major research university and one of the most respected public universities in the United States. The university offers over 250 undergraduate majors and more than 70 graduate programs. Its campus is located in Manhattan, Kansas, a city of about 50,000 people.</p>"
