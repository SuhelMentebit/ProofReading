            data: "<p><b>Barrington College</b> is a private college located in the city of Sydney, Australia. The college was established in the year 1881 and is the oldest private college in New South Wales. It is affiliated with the University of Sydney and offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in a variety of disciplines such as business, economics, law, engineering, and education.</p><p>The Ashmore and Cartier Islands are two small, uninhabited islands located in the Southern Indian Ocean, between Australia's northwest coast and Indonesia. Discovered by Europeans in the early 19th century, the islands were first annexed by the British in 1855 and subsequently claimed by Australia in 1931. The islands are the subject of a long-standing dispute between Australia and Indonesia, with both countries claiming sovereignty over them. The islands are home to an array of marine life, and are also important breeding grounds for many species of seabirds.</p>"
