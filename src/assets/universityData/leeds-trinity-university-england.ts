            data: "<p><b>Leeds Trinity University</b>, formerly known as Trinity and All Saints College, is a public university located in Leeds, England. It was founded in 1966 as a teacher training college, and gained university status in 2012. Since then, it has become one of the leading universities for teacher education in the UK.</p><p>The university began as a training college for teachers in the Yorkshire area and was established in 1966. It was originally known as Trinity and All Saints College, and was part of the University of Leeds. The college quickly gained a reputation for excellence in teacher training, and in 1994 it was granted degree-awarding powers.</p><p>In the early 2000s, the college decided to move away from its traditional focus on teacher education, and began to diversify its curriculum. This led to a rebranding of the college in 2007, with the new name Leeds Trinity University College. In 2011, the college was awarded university status, and became Leeds Trinity University.</p><p>Today, Leeds Trinity University offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, including degrees in business, computing, education, English, media, and psychology. It is also home to the Centre for Research in Media and Cultural Studies, which is dedicated to exploring the relationship between media, culture, and society.</p>"
