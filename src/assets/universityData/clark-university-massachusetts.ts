            data: "<p><b>Clark University</b> is a private research university located in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1887 and is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the state. Originally a small liberal arts college, the University has since grown to encompass a wide range of programs, including graduate and professional studies, and is best known for its psychology, economics, and geography departments. </p><p>The university was founded by Jonas Clark, a successful businessman and philanthropist. Clark's vision was to create a university that was “unconventional in its teaching, advanced in its research, and broad in its scope.” In 1889, the university opened its doors with a faculty of six and a student body of 43. </p><p>In the early 20th century, Clark shifted its focus toward graduate education and research, and began offering master’s and doctoral degrees in various disciplines. This period saw the university become one of the first to accept women on an equal basis with men. From the 1940s onward, Clark has continued to expand its academic programs, research opportunities, and campus facilities. </p><p>Today, Clark is a major research institution, with over 2,400 students from across the United States and the world. The university is home to a large and diverse faculty and staff, and offers a variety of programs for both undergraduates and graduate students. Clark is also known for its commitment to sustainability, and is a leader in green building initiatives on campus.</p>"
