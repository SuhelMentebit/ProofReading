            data: "<p><b>Carleton College</b> is a private liberal arts college located in Northfield, Minnesota. Founded in 1866, it is one of the oldest liberal arts colleges in the United States. Carleton is the only private college in the state of Minnesota. </p><p>Carleton was founded by Minnesota Congregationalists and named after William Carleton of Charlestown, Massachusetts, a benefactor of the college. Carleton's first president was the Reverend Edward N. Front, who was instrumental in the founding of the college. </p><p>In the early years of Carleton, the college struggled financially, but the school was able to stay afloat through generous donations from alumni, benefactors, and the Congregational Church. </p><p>In the early 1900s, Carleton was one of the first colleges to offer courses in the sciences and to introduce laboratory classes. The college also began offering courses in the arts and humanities. </p><p>In the mid-20th century, Carleton experienced a period of tremendous growth. The college adopted a self-governance system and began to expand its academic offerings. In 1954, Carleton established its first graduate program, in mathematics. </p><p>Today, Carleton College is one of the most highly regarded liberal arts colleges in the United States. The college offers more than 40 majors and over 40 minors, and has an undergraduate enrollment of nearly 2,000 students. Carleton is also home to a variety of research centers and institutes, including the Carleton Institute for Global Studies and the Cowling Arboretum.</p>"
