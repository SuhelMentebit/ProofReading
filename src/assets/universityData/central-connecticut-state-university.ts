Founded in 1849 as the State Normal School, it is the oldest publicly funded university in Connecticut. It is part of the Connecticut State University System, which also oversees Eastern Connecticut State University, Western Connecticut State University, and Southern Connecticut State University.</p><p>The State Normal School was established by an act of the Connecticut General Assembly in 1849. The school was created to train teachers for the common schools of Connecticut. Initially, classes were held in the basement of a local church before moving to its current location in the mid-19th century. In 1922, the school was renamed to the Connecticut State Teachers College, and in 1959 it was renamed again to its current name, Central Connecticut State College. In 1983, the school was granted university status and was renamed Central Connecticut State University.</p><p>Today, CCSU offers over 100 degree programs in the arts and sciences, business, and education.
