            data: `<p><b>California College of the Arts (CCA)</b> was founded in 1907 in San Francisco as the California School of Fine Arts. Several leaders, including William Keith and Arthur Frank Mathews, pushed for the creation of the school, which was intended to be a "school of the people, " offering professional training in the fine arts.</p><p>In 1961, the school merged with the Oakland-based College of Arts and Crafts and the name was changed to the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC). The college underwent multiple expansions in the decades to follow, adding campuses in Oakland and San Francisco and developing several new programs, such as its photography and video program in the 1970s, its industrial design program in the 1980s, and its Digital Arts program in the 1990s.</p><p>In 2003, the school changed its name to the California College of the Arts (CCA). Since then, it has continued to expand, opening a new campus in San Jose, California in 2004, and launching new degree programs, including a Graduate Program in Design Strategy in 2006. In 2011, CCA established the Center for Art and Public Life to foster community-engaged art and design projects.</p><p>Today, CCA is a leading art and design school, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in art, design, architecture, and writing. With campuses in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, the college serves more than 1,800 students each year, and provides an inclusive and nurturing environment for students to explore the possibilities of creative expression.</p>`
