            data: "<p><b>Coleg Menai</b> is a further education college located in Bangor, North Wales, UK. It was established in the early 1970s as a result of the merger of the old Bangor Technical College and the North Wales Training College. The college was given its current name in 1975 after the Menai Strait which separates the island of Anglesey from mainland Wales. At this time, the college also adopted a new motto, ‘Gwych yn Dysgu, Gwell yn Byw’, which translates as ‘Learning is Good, Living is Better’.</p><p>Since then, Coleg Menai has grown and expanded to become one of the largest colleges in Wales. It currently offers a wide range of courses and qualifications across a variety of subject areas, including science and technology, engineering, business, health and social care, and creative and performing arts. The college also provides apprenticeship programmes, and has a thriving international student population. </p><p>In recent years, Coleg Menai has invested in new facilities and equipment, and has collaborated with a range of partners to develop innovative projects and initiatives. In 2020, the college was awarded an 'outstanding' grade by Estyn, the Welsh government's education inspectorate.</p>"
