It was founded by the Reverend Dr. Thomas Chalmers as a place where working men and women could gain access to education and training. The Institute was renamed the Kevin College in 1876 and became a technical college in 1888. In 1901, the college was renamed the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College, and then the Glasgow College of Technology in 1964.
