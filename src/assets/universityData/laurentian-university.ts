            data: "<p><b>Laurentian University</b> is a bilingual university located in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1960 as a federated university, combining the francophone Université de Sudbury and the anglophone Sudbury branch campus of the University of Toronto. Laurentian is one of only two universities in Canada with a bilingual charter allowing it to offer programs in both English and French. In 2019 it was ranked among the top 10 comprehensive universities in Canada by Maclean's Magazine.</p><p>Laurentian's history began in the 1850s, when a mission was established in Sudbury to serve the needs of Franco-Ontarians. In 1913, the Roman Catholic Church established a separate school for francophone students, which eventually became the Collège du Sacré-Coeur in 1920. In 1946, a commission was set up to explore the possibility of creating a university in Sudbury. After much debate, the commission recommended the creation of a bilingual university, which was approved in 1959. The two founding institutions, the Université de Sudbury and the Sudbury branch campus of the University of Toronto, officially federated in 1960 to form Laurentian University.</p><p>In the decades since, Laurentian has grown to become one of the largest universities in Ontario, with more than 10,000 full-time and part-time students. It offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, in addition to its research initiatives. The university has also established a number of partnerships with local organizations, such as the Greater Sudbury Public Library and the Sudbury Community Foundation, to better serve the community. Laurentian University continues to be a leader in higher education in Canada.</p>"
