            data: "<p>The <b>Irish School of Ecumenics (ISE)</b> is a research and teaching institution in Belfast, Northern Ireland, that was founded in 1976. It is the first and only ecumenical institution in the world. The ISE was founded by members of the Irish Council of Churches, which was established in 1970, and the Irish Inter-Church Meeting, which was established in 1971. The Irish Council of Churches was formed through the efforts of Rev. Dr. George Otto Simms, a United Church Minister from Belfast, who was later awarded an honorary doctorate from the ISE in 2009.</p><p>The ISE was established as an inter-disciplinary centre of advanced research and education in Christian theology, philosophy, and ethics, and has since become an international centre of excellence in the field of ecumenical studies. Its mission is to develop and promote Christian unity and understanding among churches, religious communities, and individuals throughout the world.</p><p>The ISE has four main academic disciplines: Christian Theology, Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Ethics. It offers both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, and has a strong research and publications programme. It also works closely with the Irish Council of Churches on issues of Christian unity and has hosted a series of international conferences.</p><p>In addition to its academic programmes, the ISE has a strong emphasis on public engagement and outreach. It runs a range of community initiatives and projects, and works with local, national, and international partners to promote dialogue, understanding, and reconciliation between people of different religious, cultural, and political backgrounds.</p>"
