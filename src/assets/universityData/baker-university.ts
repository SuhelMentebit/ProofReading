            data: `<p>Baker University is the oldest university in the state of Kansas and the first college in the state to be chartered by the legislature. Founded in 1858 by Methodists, the school was originally called "Baldwin Institute" and was located in the town of Palmyra, Kansas. In 1863, the school moved to its current location in nearby Baldwin City and changed its name to "Baker University" in honor of Bishop Osmon Cleander Baker, a Methodist bishop who had championed the school's founding.</p><p>In 1885, Baker University became the first university in Kansas to admit female students. The same year, the school also began offering its first four-year degree program. In 1915, the school became the first four-year college in the state to be accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</p><p>Baker University has continued to grow and expand over the years, adding new academic programs and increasing the size of its student body. Today, the university offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the liberal arts, sciences, and professional fields.</p>`
