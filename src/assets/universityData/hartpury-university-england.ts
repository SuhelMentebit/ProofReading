Hartpury University & Hartpury College is situated on a 330-acre campus and offers a range of courses from foundation degrees to postgraduate qualifications.</p><p>Hartpury University & Hartpury College has its origins in the Royal Agricultural College, which was established in 1845 to provide education and training to students of agriculture and related industries. The Royal Agricultural College was the first agricultural college to be established in the United Kingdom and was one of the first higher education institutions in the country.</p><p>In the late 1930s, the college expanded by purchasing a number of farms in the area and converted them into a training centre for agricultural students. In 1973, the college gained full university status and changed its name to Hartpury University & Hartpury College. The college went on to become a centre of excellence for animal management, land-based studies and sports coaching, and was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in 2012.</p><p>In 2017, the college and university merged to become Hartpury University & Hartpury College, which continues to provide a range of courses for students in the fields of agriculture, animal management, sports coaching, land-based studies, and more.</p>"
