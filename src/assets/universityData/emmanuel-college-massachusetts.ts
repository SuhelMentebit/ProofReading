            data: "<p><b>Emmanuel College</b> was founded in 1919 by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, an international religious order, as a Catholic liberal arts college for women. It was the first Catholic college for women in New England. In 2001, the college began admitting male students, becoming a co-ed institution. </p><p>In 2010, the college launched a new strategic plan that included the goal of becoming a nationally recognized leader in providing students with a transformative liberal arts education. </p><p>In 2018, Emmanuel received a $15 million gift from the Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation, the largest single donation in the college’s history. This gift established the Richard and Susan Smith Campus Center, a 45,000-square-foot building that opened in 2020. </p><p>Today, Emmanuel College is a thriving liberal arts college with a diverse student body of over 3,000 undergraduates. The college offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degrees, and is home to a vibrant community of scholars, researchers, and activists.</p>"
