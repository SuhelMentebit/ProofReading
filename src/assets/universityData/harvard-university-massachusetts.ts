It is one of the most prestigious universities in the world and has educated countless influential figures in its history. Harvard was founded by the Massachusetts legislature and named after its first benefactor, John Harvard, a young minister whose bequest of half his estate and his library of 400 books helped to establish the school. Harvard’s first classes were held in 1638 and the first degrees were awarded in 1642. Since then, Harvard has grown exponentially and now consists of 12 schools and institutes that offer a wide variety of degrees. Harvard has had a long and storied history, and its graduates have gone on to become leaders in a wide range of fields, from politics to academia. The university has also been home to some of the world’s most influential thinkers, from Mark Twain and Ralph Waldo Emerson to Barack Obama. Today, Harvard remains a leader in higher education and is considered one of the most prestigious universities in the world.</p>"
