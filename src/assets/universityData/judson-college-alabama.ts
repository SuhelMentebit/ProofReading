Founded in 1838, Judson is the oldest women’s college in the state of Alabama and one of the oldest in the United States. The college was founded by members of the Siloam Baptist Church, who sought to provide an education for women that emphasized morality, piety, and Christian values. </p><p>Since its founding, Judson College has consistently been a leader in the education of women in the South. It was the first college in Alabama to offer a degree in music, and the first in the state to offer degrees in physical education, nursing, and business. </p><p>In the 1960s, Judson College began to expand its curriculum to include more programs and majors, while still preserving the college’s commitment to providing a quality liberal arts education. In the 70s and 80s, the college began offering graduate programs in education and business administration. </p><p>Today, Judson College is a fully accredited liberal arts college offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, including nursing, education, business, and the sciences.
