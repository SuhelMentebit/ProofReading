            data: "<p><b>Cornell College</b> was founded in 1853 in Mount Vernon, Iowa. It is a private, coeducational liberal arts college that provides an academically rigorous education and emphasizes the importance of faculty-student engagement. The college was founded by George Bryant Bowman, a Methodist minister and abolitionist and was named after his mentor, Ezra Cornell. Originally, the college was a men's college, but it became coeducational in 1872.</p><p>The college is known for its unique “One Course at a Time” program which allows students to focus on one course at a time, rather than juggling multiple courses at once. The college also offers an array of study abroad programs, service-learning opportunities, and internship programs.</p><p>Today, Cornell College is an independent, residential liberal arts college with over 1,000 students. The college offers more than 40 majors and minors and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.</p>"
