            data: "<p><b>Hastings College</b> is a private, four-year liberal arts college located in Hastings, Nebraska. It was founded in 1882 by a group of pioneers and clergymen who wanted to establish a college in the region. It was the first college to be established in Nebraska, and the first college to be founded by the Methodist Church.</p><p>The college began by offering a two-year program, and by 1889 it had grown to a four-year program. In the early years, the college was heavily influenced by the methods of the German universities, and the curriculum was largely based on the German model. In the 1920s, the college began to embrace a more Americanized approach, and the curriculum was broadened to include more courses in the liberal arts and sciences. </p><p>Over the years, Hastings College has developed and grown, offering a number of majors and degree programs. It has also established several centers and institutes, such as the Center for Civic Engagement, the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, the Center for Rural and Urban Studies, and the Institute for Leadership Studies. Today, Hastings College is a vibrant and diverse learning community, with students from all over the world.</p>"
