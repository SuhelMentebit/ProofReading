            data: "<p><b>Antioch College</b> is a private liberal arts college in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection, the college began operating in 1852 with the motto “Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.”</p><p>In 1863, the college was seized by the U.S. government and used as a military hospital during the Civil War. After the war, the college reopened in 1866 and began to offer degrees in 1891. In 1896, the college became the first in the nation to offer a co-educational program.</p><p>In 1908, the college changed its name to Antioch College and moved to its current location in Yellow Springs. In the 1920s, the college began to emphasize experiential learning, and in the 1930s, it was one of the first colleges in the United States to offer a work-study program.</p><p>In 2008, the college suspended operations due to financial difficulties, but in 2009, it was re-established with a new focus on sustainability and experiential learning. Today, Antioch College continues to offer a unique liberal arts education that emphasizes social justice, critical thinking, and leadership.</p>"
