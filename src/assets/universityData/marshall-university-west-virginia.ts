At the time of the merger, Shepherd College had around 1000 students, while Marshall College had around 2000.</p><p>In 1970, the West Virginia Legislature officially changed the name of the school to Marshall University. The school is now one of the largest universities in the state, with an enrollment of over 12,000.
