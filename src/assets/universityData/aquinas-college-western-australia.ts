            data: `<p><b>Aquinas College</b> is an independent Catholic co-educational high school located in Salter Point, Western Australia. It was founded in 1963 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers and is part of Edmund Rice Education Australia.</p><p>Aquinas College was opened in 1963 as an all-boys boarding school by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. The school was established in response to an increasing demand for Catholic secondary education in Perth. The first group of students were boarders in the original building on the site, now known as "The Monastery". </p><p>In 1974, the College became co-educational and began to accept day-students, in addition to boarders. The first female boarders were welcomed in 1976. </p><p>In the early 1980s, the College moved from the original site to its current location in Salter Point. The move provided more space for the growing student population and allowed for the construction of an additional classroom block, library and Performing Arts Centre. </p><p>Over the years, Aquinas College has continued to develop its facilities and educational programs. In recent years, the college has introduced new STEM courses and a range of extracurricular activities. </p><p>Today, Aquinas College continues to be a vibrant part of the local community. It remains committed to providing a quality Catholic education to its students, and to fostering a sense of community and belonging.</p>`
