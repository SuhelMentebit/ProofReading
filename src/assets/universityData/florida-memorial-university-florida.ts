            data: "<p><b>Florida Memorial University</b> is a private, historically black university in Miami Gardens, Florida. It is the only historically black university in South Florida. The university was founded in 1879 by a group of black leaders in the United States, who had the goal of providing a quality education to African Americans in the South.</p><p>The university was originally called Florida Baptist Institute, and opened its doors in 1879 with just 11 students. The school was later renamed Florida Baptist Academy, and in 1923, moved to its present location in Miami Gardens, then known as Opa-locka. In 1941, the school was renamed Florida Memorial College to honor the contributions of African Americans to the state of Florida.</p><p>In 1968, the college became accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and changed its name to Florida Memorial University. It was the first historically black university in Florida to receive accreditation. In 2011, the university launched its first doctoral program, an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership. Today, Florida Memorial University offers more than 30 undergraduate and graduate degree programs.</p>"
