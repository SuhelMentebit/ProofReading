            data: `<p>The <b>College of the Holy Cross</b> is a private Jesuit liberal arts college located in Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1843, Holy Cross is the oldest Catholic college in New England and one of the oldest in the United States.</p><p>The college was founded in 1843 by Benedict Joseph Fenwick, SJ, second Bishop of Boston and a Jesuit. The Jesuit community of St. Joseph's College (now Boston College) was invited to relocate to the then-vacant building, which they accepted. At the same time, Bishop Fenwick gave the college its name. In his own words, "This name I give it in honor of the Blessed Virgin, whose divine Son has been so long the light, the strength, and the glory of the Catholic Church."</p><p>The College of the Holy Cross has a long and storied history. In the early days of the college, the curriculum was focused on classical education and literature, with a heavy emphasis on Latin, Greek, and rhetoric. Over the years, the college has grown and evolved, offering a more diverse range of courses and programs, including the STEM fields. The college is also home to a number of distinguished centers and institutes, such as the Center for Religion, Ethics, and Culture and the Institute for Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies.</p><p>Today, the College of the Holy Cross is a highly selective liberal arts college with a student body of approximately 2,800. The college offers a range of majors and minors, as well as several interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. The college is also home to a number of clubs, organizations, and events, including the annual Holy Cross Festival of the Arts. The college's campus is located on 135 acres overlooking the city of Worcester and is home to numerous historical buildings and monuments.</p>`
