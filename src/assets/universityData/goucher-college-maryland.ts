            data: "<p><b>Goucher College</b>, located in Towson, Maryland, is a private liberal arts college founded in 1885. It was founded as the Woman's College of Baltimore by philanthropist John Franklin Goucher, who also served as its first president. The college was initially founded to provide a quality education to women of the region, who were largely excluded from most higher education.</p><p>In the early 1920s, the college began to admit men and by the mid-1970s, it became fully coeducational. In the following decades, the college began to expand its academic programs, leading to the establishment of the School of Education in 1985, the Center for International Studies in 1989, and the Center for Social Justice in 1997.</p><p>Today, Goucher College is one of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in the country, offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs. The college also has a strong commitment to social justice and community engagement, and it is home to a number of initiatives designed to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus.</p>"
