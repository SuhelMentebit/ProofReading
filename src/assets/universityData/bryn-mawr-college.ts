            data: "<p><b>Bryn Mawr College</b> is a women's liberal arts college located in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1885 by Quaker educator Joseph Taylor, the school was one of the first American colleges to offer graduate education for women. As of 2020, the college enrolls approximately 1,400 students from around the world.</p><p>The school's mission to provide a quality education for women was revolutionary for its time. At the time of its founding, most women were denied access to higher education. The school was designed to create a space for women to pursue their intellectual and personal growth. In the early years, the curriculum was focused on the classical liberal arts, but the school soon expanded to include a wide range of disciplines.</p><p>Over the years, Bryn Mawr College has become known for its rigorous academics and strong sense of community. The college has graduated many notable alumni, including writer and playwright Alice Walker and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Today, the college continues to be a leader in providing an education to women and a liberal arts education to all.</p>"
