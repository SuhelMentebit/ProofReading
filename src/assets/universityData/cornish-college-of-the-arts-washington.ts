            data: "<p><b>Cornish College of the Arts</b> was founded in 1914 by Nellie Cornish, a pioneering educator who recognized the need for a college dedicated to the arts and humanities. At the time, there were few higher education opportunities for artists in the Seattle area. In 1923, Cornish moved the college from its original location on Capitol Hill to its current home in the historic Aloha Building in Seattle’s First Hill neighborhood.</p><p>In the 1970s, Cornish experienced a period of significant growth, leading to the construction of its first residence hall and the creation of several new programs and departments. In 1979, Cornish became an independent, non-profit college and began offering undergraduate degrees. In the 1980s, the college continued to grow, establishing new departments and programs and expanding its facilities. </p><p>In 2000, Cornish became the first college in the Pacific Northwest to receive accreditation in both the visual and performing arts. In 2005, Cornish opened the Bagley Wright Theater and the Cornish Playhouse at Seattle Center. In 2006, the college opened the historic Kerry Hall and the Arts Atrium, which houses classrooms and the college’s main administrative offices.</p><p>Today, Cornish College of the Arts offers a range of degrees in the visual and performing arts, as well as art history and music theory. The college also offers a variety of outreach programs and public events, including performances, exhibitions, lectures, and workshops.</p>"
