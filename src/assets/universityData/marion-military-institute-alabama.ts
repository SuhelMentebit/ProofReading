            data: "<p><b>Marion Military Institute (MMI)</b> is a public, military junior college in Marion, Alabama. Established in 1842, it is the oldest military junior college in the United States. The school was founded by the Alabama State Legislature and later chartered by the Confederacy during the Civil War.</p><p>MMI's original mission was to train cadets to become officers in the Confederate Army. It opened its doors in October 1842 and graduated its first class of cadets (which included future Confederate General John B. Gordon) in June 1843.</p><p>The school remained open during the Civil War, but enrollment declined drastically due to the conflict. After the war, the school changed its mission to train officers for the United States Army and Navy. In 1887, the school was granted a charter from the United States Congress, allowing it to grant degrees.</p><p>In the early 20th century, MMI became a popular choice for military training for high school and college students. During World War I, the school served as a training center for the U.S. Army’s Officers Reserve Corps. During World War II, MMI trained thousands of cadets for the U.S. military.</p><p>Today, MMI is a two-year junior college that offers a variety of educational programs, including a bachelor's degree in Military Science. The school also offers a range of Army and Air Force ROTC programs.</p>"
