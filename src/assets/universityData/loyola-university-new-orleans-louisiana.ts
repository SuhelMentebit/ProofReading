            data: "<p><b>Loyola University New Orleans</b> was founded in 1912 by the Society of Jesus, a Catholic religious order also known as the Jesuits. The university initially had a primary focus on providing a classical education, with an emphasis on the liberal arts, languages, and literature. In 1923, the university began offering degree programs in the fields of business, nursing, and education.</p><p>In 1947, Loyola was the first university in the South to integrate its student body when it admitted four African-American students. In response, the state of Louisiana temporarily withdrew its funding for the university, but Loyola refused to back down and continued to accept students of all races.</p><p>In the 1960s, Loyola began offering degrees in the fields of engineering, science, and social work. In 1970, the university established a School of Law and a School of Mass Communication. In 1972, the university opened its first college abroad, in Rome, Italy. This marked the beginning of Loyola's commitment to international education.</p><p>Today, Loyola is a comprehensive university offering degree programs in more than 60 fields of study. With its diverse student body, commitment to academic excellence, and focus on Jesuit values, Loyola remains one of the top universities in the region.</p>"
