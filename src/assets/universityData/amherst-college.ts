            data: "<p><b>Amherst College</b> was founded in 1821 by a group of Protestant ministers, including Gregory Townsend and John Smyth. It was initially a men's college, though it has since become coeducational. Its original purpose was to provide an opportunity for students to study a broad range of subjects in preparation for the ministry. </p><p>The college moved to its current location in the rural town of Amherst, Massachusetts in 1825. The college remained small until the mid-20th century when it began to grow rapidly. In the 1960s and 70s, the college experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion, with new facilities, programs and faculty being added. </p><p>Today, Amherst is one of the top liberal arts colleges in the United States. It is consistently ranked among the top liberal arts institutions in the country and is highly respected for its academic excellence. It offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degree programs and is home to a diverse student body.</p>"
