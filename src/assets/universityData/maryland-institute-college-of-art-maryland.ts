            data: `<p>The <b>Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)</b> is an independent college of art and design located in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1826, it is the oldest continuously degree-granting college of art in the United States. The college enrolls nearly 3,500 undergraduate, graduate, and continuing studies students from 49 states and 52 countries in fine arts, design, electronic media, art education, liberal arts, and professional studies degree and non-credit programs. MICA is a leader in the world of visual arts featuring numerous galleries, exhibitions, and special events.</p><p>MICA was founded in 1826 when leaders of the Baltimore community formed the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts. The institute was intended to "promote the mechanic arts, and to extend the knowledge of the principles and pursuits which are connected with them." In the following decades, the institute began offering classes in drawing, sculpture, design, and photography. In 1912, the institute was renamed Maryland Institute College of Art, and in 1969, it began granting bachelor's degrees. Today, MICA is one of the top art colleges in the United States and is ranked among the top 25 graduate art schools in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.</p>`
