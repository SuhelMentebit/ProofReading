            data: "<p><b>Irish Baptist College</b> was founded in 1853 in Moira, Northern Ireland. The college was originally established by the Baptist Missionary Society to provide theological education for its missionaries. In 1878, the college was recognized by Queen's College Belfast, and in 1880 it became a constituent college of the University of London.</p><p>In the late 19th century, the college expanded its curriculum to provide a broader liberal arts education, including the arts and sciences, and began to admit women. In 1904, the college was renamed the Irish Baptist College & University College, and began to offer degrees in theology and arts.</p><p>In the 1920s, the college moved to Belfast, and in the 1950s it merged with the Ulster College of Preachers to become the Irish Baptist College & Theological College. In the 1970s, the college moved to its current location in Moira, and in 1985 it was granted degree awarding powers. Today, the college continues to offer a range of undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees in theology and arts.</p>"
