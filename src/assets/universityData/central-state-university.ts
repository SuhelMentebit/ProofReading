The college was named in honor of William Wilberforce, a British abolitionist, and was the first private African-American college in the United States. Wilberforce University initially offered a general liberal arts education but later incorporated professional courses in theology, education, and business in its curriculum. </p><p>In 1941, the state of Ohio purchased the college and it became the Wilberforce State College. In 1951, the college began offering its first graduate program, a master’s degree in education. In 1965, the college was renamed the Central State University to reflect its expanding academic programs and to recognize the larger region it served.</p><p>In the 1970s, Central State University began offering doctoral programs in Education and in Human Services Administration. It also established an Honors College in 1993 in order to provide an enriched academic experience for its top students. The university also expanded its online degree programs. </p><p>Today, Central State University offers more than 40 undergraduate and graduate programs in areas such as business, education, and the sciences.
