            data: "<p><b>Flinders University</b> is a public university in Adelaide, South Australia. It was founded in 1966, and is named in honour of navigator Matthew Flinders, who explored and surveyed the South Australian coastline in the early 19th century.</p><p>Flinders University was founded in 1966 as the fourth university in South Australia, and the first in the state to be established outside of Adelaide. The university was established on the former wartime airbase of RAAF Station Largs Bay, which had been donated by the federal government to the state government. The first students enrolled in 1970, and the first degrees were awarded in 1975. The university has since grown significantly, with the current student population standing at over 22,000.</p><p>The university has a strong focus on research and teaching, and has established itself as one of the leading universities in Australia. In 2016, Flinders University was ranked in the top two percent of universities worldwide by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. It has a strong focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, and was the first university in Australia to establish a dedicated Innovation and Entrepreneurship Hub.</p>"
