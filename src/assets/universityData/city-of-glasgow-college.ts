            data: "<p>The <b>City of Glasgow College</b> is one of Scotland’s largest further and higher education providers. It was formed in 2010 from a merger of four Glasgow colleges: Central College, Glasgow Metropolitan College, Glasgow College of Nautical Studies, and Glasgow College of Food Technology.</p><p>The history of the four colleges that merged to form City of Glasgow College dates back over 100 years. The Central College of Commerce was established in 1909 and was the first college in the city to provide evening classes. The Glasgow Commercial College was established in 1910, and in 1911 the Glasgow College of Nautical Studies opened. The Glasgow College of Food Technology was the last of the four to be established, in 1964.</p><p>In 2010 these four colleges merged to form City of Glasgow College. Since then, the college has gone from strength to strength, delivering courses in a range of subjects, from business and hospitality to engineering and creative industries.</p><p>The college has also opened three new campuses in the city, including the award-winning Riverside Campus, which opened in 2012. The college is now the largest provider of further and higher education in Scotland, and is a major contributor to the local economy.</p>"
