            data: `<p><b>Lafayette College</b> is a private liberal arts college in Easton, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1826 by James Madison Porter, it is the ninth-oldest college in the United States. The college was founded in Easton after citizens of Easton appealed to James Madison Porter to establish a college in the city. Porter, a graduate of Princeton University, requested a charter from the Legislature, and the college was chartered as the "Trustees of Lafayette College" on February 1, 1826. The school opened its doors to its first class of students in 1829. </p><p>The college's first building was Pardee Hall, which still stands today. In 1857, the college moved to its current location on College Hill. The college has grown steadily over the years, adding new buildings and programs. Today, Lafayette boasts a strong liberal arts curriculum, and is known for its engineering, mathematics, and business programs.</p>`
