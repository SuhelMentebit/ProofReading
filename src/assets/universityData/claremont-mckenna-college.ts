            data: "<p><b>Claremont McKenna College (CMC)</b> is a private, coeducational liberal arts college in Claremont, California. Founded as a men's college in 1946, it was one of the Claremont Colleges that opened its doors to women in 1976. CMC is known for its strong economics, finance, international relations, and government programs, as well as its emphasis on public service.</p><p>The college was founded in 1946 by Donald B. McLaughlin, a trustee of Pomona College, as Claremont Men's College. The mission of the college was to provide an education in the liberal arts and sciences with an emphasis on public service, while also preparing students for graduate work in business, law, and public administration. As a result, the college initially focused on economics, political science, and international relations.</p><p>In 1981, CMC became the first college in the United States to require all undergraduates to complete a senior thesis. This has since become a hallmark of the college's liberal arts curriculum.</p><p>Today, CMC is one of the most selective liberal arts colleges in the country, admitting fewer than 10% of applicants. The college is also known for its strong sense of community, which is reflected in the number of alumni who return to campus for reunions and other events.</p><p>CMC continues to emphasize the values of public service and leadership, and its graduates have gone on to become prominent leaders in business, government, and academia.</p>"
