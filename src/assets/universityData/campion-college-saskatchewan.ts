            data: "<p><b>Campion College</b> was established in 1917 as a Roman Catholic college affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan. The college was founded by the Jesuits and named after Saint Edmund Campion, an English martyr of the 16th century. Initially, Campion College offered only pre-university courses and was located in the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina. In 1925, Campion College moved to its present location on the University of Saskatchewan campus in Saskatoon and began offering undergraduate courses. In 1927, the college acquired degree-granting authority from the provincial government and began offering courses leading to degrees in Arts, Science, and Education. </p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Campion College expanded its course offerings and began offering graduate programs. In the 1970s and 1980s, the college began to expand its research activities, and it now has several research centres on campus. In addition, the college has undertaken several major construction projects, including the renovation of its historic building, the construction of a new library, and the renovation of the college chapel.</p><p>Today, Campion College is a leading institution of higher learning in Canada, offering a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs in the arts, sciences, and humanities.
