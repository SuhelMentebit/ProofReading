            data:"<p><b>Loyola University Chicago</b> was founded in 1870 as St. Ignatius College by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). The college was located in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago, in a building that had been the site of the original St. Ignatius Church. In 1909, the college was renamed Loyola University, and moved to its current location on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Rogers Park neighborhood. In 1912, the school opened its first professional school, the School of Law. In the following years, Loyola opened the School of Social Work (1919), the College of Commerce (1922), the Stritch School of Medicine (1923), the School of Education (1931), and the Institute of Pastoral Studies (1948). In 1991, the school established the Graduate School of Business Administration. Today, Loyola offers more than 80 undergraduate and more than 80 graduate and professional programs. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.</p>"
