            data: "<p><b>First Nations University of Canada (FNUniv)</b> is a First Nation-governed university in Saskatchewan, Canada. It is a member of the Saskatchewan Inter-Institutional Alliance (SIAA) and the only university in the province that is governed by First Nations. </p><p>FNUniv began its journey in 1976, when the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN) established a non-profit corporation called the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College (SICC). The purpose of the SICC was to provide an education to First Nations students that was culturally relevant and appropriate. </p><p>In 1979, the FSIN and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) signed an agreement that allowed the SICC to offer programs of study leading to certificates and diplomas. In 1981, the SICC was officially granted degree-granting status. In June of 2003, the SICC changed its name to the First Nations University of Canada. </p><p>Today, the FNUniv offers degree programs in Arts, Business Administration, Education, Science, and Social Work. The university is committed to providing an education that is culturally relevant and appropriate to First Nations students.</p>"
