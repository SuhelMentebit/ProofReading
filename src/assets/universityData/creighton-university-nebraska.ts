In the early 20th century, Creighton established a medical school, which was later renamed the School of Medicine. In the 1950s, the university began expanding its academic programs to include a law school and a business school.</p><p>Today, Creighton has nine schools and colleges, including the College of Arts and Sciences, the Heider College of Business, the School of Law, the School of Medicine and the Graduate School. The university is also home to the Creighton University Research and Innovation Campus (CURIC), which focuses on research and innovation in the areas of health sciences, technology and engineering.</p><p>In addition to its academic offerings, Creighton is also home to a number of student organizations, athletics teams, and a variety of cultural and artistic events.
