Founded in 1929, Cal Maritime is the only degree-granting maritime academy on the West Coast of the United States. Cal Maritime offers undergraduate degrees in business administration, global studies and logistics, marine engineering technology, marine transportation, and mechanical engineering.</p><p>The history of Cal Maritime dates back to 1920, when the California Legislature authorized the establishment of the California Nautical School. The school opened in 1929 and was located at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo. In 1945, the school was renamed the California Maritime Academy and began to offer courses leading to a bachelor’s degree. In the 1950s, the Academy began to offer graduate courses, and in the 1970s, the school was moved to its current location in Vallejo. Today, Cal Maritime is part of the California State University system and is the only maritime academy in the West Coast of the United States.</p>"
