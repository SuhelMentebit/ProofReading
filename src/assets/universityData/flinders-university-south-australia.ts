Founded in 1966, it was named in honor of navigator Matthew Flinders, who explored and surveyed the South Australian coastline in the early 19th century.</p><p>Flinders University began life as a college associated with the University of Adelaide. The institution was established in 1966 by the amalgamation of two colleges, the South Australian School of Mines and Industries and the Sturt Teachers College. In 1969, the college became an independent university and was renamed Flinders University.</p><p>In the 1970s, the university developed rapidly, establishing several new faculties and schools, and increasing its student numbers. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university continued to grow and develop, establishing new campuses and institutes. In the early 2000s, the university underwent a major transformation, with the introduction of a new campus in Tonsley and the development of the Flinders Medical Centre.</p><p>Today, Flinders University is one of Australia's leading universities, with a strong focus on research and teaching excellence. The university offers a wide range of courses in the sciences, humanities, arts, and business, and is home to a number of world-class research institutes and centres.</p>"
