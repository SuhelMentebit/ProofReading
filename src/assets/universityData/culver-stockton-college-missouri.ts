            data: "<p><b>Culver-Stockton College</b> is a private, four-year liberal arts college located in Canton, Missouri. Founded in 1853, it is the oldest college in Missouri and was originally known as Canton College. It began as a Presbyterian school, and was founded by a group of local citizens who were inspired by the example of John Culver and William Stockton, two local leaders who were active in the early days of the Presbyterian Church.<p></p>Culver-Stockton College was initially located at the old Canton Academy building, which was built in 1851. The school initially offered both secondary and post-secondary education, but eventually transitioned to a college-only focus. In 1882, the school was renamed Culver-Stockton College in honor of the two men who had been instrumental in its founding.<p></p>Over the years, Culver-Stockton College has continued to grow and evolve. It has added new programs, expanded its campus, and developed its academic offerings. Today, the college offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.
