            data: `<p><b>Blinn College-Brenham Campus</b> was founded in 1883 as a private junior college. It was known as the "Brenham Academy" and was owned and operated by the Methodist Church. In 1909, the college became public and was renamed "Brenham Normal College" to reflect the college's mission of training teachers. In 1923, the name of the college was changed to Blinn College in honor of Reverend Christian Blinn, a Methodist minister who had donated the land for the original campus.</p><p>In 1966, Blinn College became part of the newly formed Blinn Junior College District. The college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1967. In 1971, the college opened a new campus in Brenham, Texas. The campus is now the main campus for Blinn College and offers a wide range of associate degree and certificate programs. Over the years, the college has grown and expanded its program offerings to include a variety of educational options for students. Today, Blinn College-Brenham Campus serves more than 10,000 students each year.</p>`
