            data: "<p><b>Gonzaga University</b> is a private, Roman Catholic university in Spokane, Washington. Founded in 1887 by the Society of Jesus, it is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. It is named for the young Jesuit saint Aloysius Gonzaga. The university offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees through its seven colleges and schools.</p><p>Gonzaga was founded in 1887 by Father Joseph Cataldo, a Jesuit from Italy. He was sent to the Pacific Northwest to establish a Catholic school in the Spokane area. Cataldo built a small wooden building on the corner of what is now Spokane Falls Boulevard and Boone Avenue and opened Gonzaga College on August 21, 1887. The school was originally a preparatory school for young men preparing to enter the Jesuit order.</p><p>In 1912, the school was granted university status and began offering degrees in a variety of subjects. Over the years, the university expanded, adding new colleges and schools and introducing new programs. Today, Gonzaga is a comprehensive university offering more than 80 majors and minors, as well as graduate and professional programs. The university is also home to a thriving student body of more than 7,500 students from all over the world.</p>"
