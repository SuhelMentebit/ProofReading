            data: "<p>The <b>Dalhousie Agricultural Campus (DAC)</b> is located in Bible Hill, Nova Scotia, Canada and is part of Dalhousie University. The campus was established in 1905 as the Nova Scotia Agricultural College, and was the first agricultural college in Canada. It was founded in response to the need for agricultural education in the province and to help promote rural and agricultural development in Nova Scotia. The original campus was located in Truro, but in 1951 it was moved to Bible Hill.</p><p>In 1963, the college became part of Dalhousie University and was renamed the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus. Since then, the campus has continued to grow and expand. In 2012, the Nova Scotia government announced the development of the Nova Scotia Institute of Agri-Food and Applied Sciences, a $45 million initiative to upgrade the facilities of the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus and create a centre of excellence for agri-food research and innovation. The institute was officially opened in 2016. </p><p>Today, the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus offers a wide range of degree, diploma and certificate programs in areas such as agriculture, food science, aquaculture, environmental studies and natural resources. The campus also operates several research centres, including the Nova Scotia Institute of Agri-Food and Applied Sciences, the Centre for Pesticide Management and the Centre for Aquaculture and Seafood Development.</p>"
