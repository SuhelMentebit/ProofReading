            data: "<p><b>Haskell Indian Nations University (HINU)</b> is a tribal university located in Lawrence, Kansas, United States. It was established in 1884 as the United States Indian Industrial Training School. The institution was originally founded to provide vocational education to American Indians of the Great Plains area. Over the years, the school has grown and evolved into a fully accredited four-year university.</p><p>Haskell was the first university in the world to be founded and funded by the federal government for the education of American Indians. From its founding in 1884 until the early 1990s, Haskell was operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) as a “bi-lingual, bi-cultural” institution.</p><p>In 1993, the BIA transferred control of Haskell to the newly-created Haskell Indian Nations University, a tribally-controlled university. This transfer of control marked a significant milestone in the history of the university, as it allowed the school to become more independent from the BIA and more focused on the needs of its students.</p><p>Today, Haskell is a fully accredited four-year university offering bachelor’s degrees in six disciplines as well as a master’s degree in Professional Counseling. The university is open to all American Indian and Alaska Native students, regardless of tribal affiliation. It also serves as a training center for American Indian professionals, providing technical and professional development in a variety of disciplines.</p>"
