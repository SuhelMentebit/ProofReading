            data: "<p>The <b>Harrisburg Area Community College (HACC)</b> was founded in 1964 with the merger of two local institutions - the Harrisburg Area Technical School and the Harrisburg Junior College. HACC was the first community college in Pennsylvania. Initially, HACC's primary mission was to provide technical education in the region by offering Associate Degree programs in a variety of disciplines. In its early days, the college served a predominantly white student population. </p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, HACC continued to expand its educational offerings by introducing more academic programs, such as Associate Degrees in Liberal Arts and Sciences. The college also began to offer a variety of noncredit programs and services, such as adult education classes and community outreach initiatives. During this period, HACC also began to serve a more diverse student population, including students from underserved populations.</p><p>In the 1990s, HACC underwent a massive expansion. The college opened its first off-campus center in Lancaster, PA and established a Virtual Campus, which provided students with access to online courses and services. HACC also opened its first residence hall, making it the first community college in Pennsylvania to offer on-campus housing. </p><p>In the 2000s, HACC continued to expand its academic offerings by developing new programs and services. The college opened a Learning Center in Harrisburg, PA and established a new Center for Business and Industry, which provides a variety of educational and training services to local businesses. In recent years, HACC has also launched several innovative initiatives, such as the “Complete the Degree” program, which helps students who have previously earned some college credits to complete their degree. </p><p>Today, HACC is one of the largest community colleges in Pennsylvania, serving more than 17,000 credit and noncredit students each year. The college offers more than 150 academic programs, as well as a variety of student services, such as career and academic counseling, tutoring, and financial aid. HACC is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and is committed to providing accessible, affordable, and quality education to students in the Harrisburg area.</p>"
