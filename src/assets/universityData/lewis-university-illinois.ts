            data: "<p><b>Lewis University</b> is a private Roman Catholic university in Romeoville, Illinois. Founded in 1932 by the Archdiocese of Chicago, Lewis University was originally named the Holy Name Technical School. Its mission was to provide technical and vocational training to Catholic men who were unable to attend college due to economic constraints. In 1935, the school was renamed Lewis College of Science and Technology, and the curriculum was expanded to include liberal arts courses. In 1945, the college was renamed Lewis University, and the school moved to its current location in Romeoville, Illinois. In the 1950s and 1960s, the university added several new degree programs, including nursing and aviation, and established a graduate school. The university continued to expand its academic offerings and established several new schools, including the College of Nursing and Health Professions in 1974, the College of Business in 1983, and the College of Education in 1994. Today, Lewis University offers more than 80 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the liberal arts, sciences, and professional studies.</p>"
