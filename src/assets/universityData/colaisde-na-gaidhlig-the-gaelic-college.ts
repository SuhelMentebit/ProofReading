            data: "<p>The <b>Gaelic College in Nova Scotia, Canada,</b> was founded in 1938 by the late Dr. A.F. MacKenzie. MacKenzie, who was born in Scotland, had a great love and respect for the Gaelic language, culture, and traditions of Scotland and Nova Scotia. He felt that the best way to preserve and promote the language was to create a college that would provide educational opportunities and resources for those wishing to learn about and practice Gaelic language and culture.</p><p>The college is located in St. Ann's, Cape Breton and offers courses in Gaelic language, music, history, dance, and other cultural activities. The college also sponsors an annual gathering of people interested in Gaelic culture and language, which is held in July. The college has received support from the governments of both Scotland and Nova Scotia, as well as from private donors. In addition, the college has also hosted various cultural and educational events, including concerts, festivals, and workshops.</p><p>Today, the college is a vibrant centre for Gaelic language and culture and continues to be a source of pride for the people of Nova Scotia.</p>"
