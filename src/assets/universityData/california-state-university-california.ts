            data: "<p><b>California State University (CSU)</b> is a public university system consisting of 23 campuses throughout the state of California. It was established in 1857 and is one of the oldest state university systems in the United States. The CSU system is the largest system of four-year higher education in the country and is the largest university system in the United States by enrollment.</p><p>The history of CSU dates back to the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the subsequent statehood of California in 1850. The first college in the state of California was founded in 1851 and was located in San Jose. This college eventually became the University of the Pacific, which is now a private university. In 1857, the California Legislature established the first California State Normal School, which was located in San Francisco. This school eventually became San Jose State University and was the first public university in the state of California.</p><p>In 1961, the California Master Plan for Higher Education was created and outlined the mission of the CSU system. This plan led to the merge of several state college systems and the creation of the CSU system as it exists today. The CSU system now includes 23 campuses and serves nearly 500,000 students annually.</p>"
