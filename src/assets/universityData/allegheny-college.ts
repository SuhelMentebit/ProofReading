            data: "<p><b>Allegheny College</b> is a private liberal arts college in Meadville, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1815 and is one of the oldest colleges in the United States. The college was founded by the Reverend Timothy Alden, a graduate of Harvard University, and grew out of the Free School of Meadville, which he had established in 1811. The college was initially associated with the United Church of Christ and was the first college founded west of the Allegheny Mountains.</p><p>In its early years, the college focused on educating the children of local settlers and ministers. During the Civil War, the college saw a brief decline in enrollment, but by the end of the 19th century, it had become a nationally recognized institution. In the 20th century, the college broadened its curriculum to include science and engineering, and in the 21st century, it has continued to expand its academic offerings. Today, Allegheny College is a top-ranked liberal arts college with a student body of around 2,000.</p>"
